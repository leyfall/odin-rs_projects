**Coding Projects**

_Coding journey and history._

Putting all of the stuffs I'll learn for everyday.

studying everyday till I ~~learn all the foundamental~~ somebody ask me "Hey can I use that?" or "Let me pay/play that"

Day 1 - 12.18.25

Flow -- but learning back the basics of odin.

Day 2 - 12.19.25

Learning that the phase of learning to code (again) will be very much painful, knowing you can do it for the best.

       (which was written by the founder of The Odin Project. This article gives a realistic view of what the journey ahead is like)
       
 Web design reading it on wiki. 
 
        (describes the breadth of the web development profession.)
Reading the "Udacity’s blog post on front-end, back-end and full stack developers"

Day 3 - 12.20.25 (Late study and doing things)

Stuffs to learn how to manage time and productivity in focus + the what to do  in breaks.

Avoid AI for asking a question -- used the Odin Community + Google

Day 4 - 12.21.25

Putting a new project to learn such as the new single page cv something.

Asking a question in TOP discord:

       So, to summarize, don't ask "Any Java experts around?", but rather ask "How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"

Adding the "projects" branches so i can see it in different branch and not in the main one.

Day 5 - 12.22.25

Taking notes and learning in my Kindle V about Fundamentals stuffs in Github.

1st Class Language you need to know:
        
         - Ruby, Javascript (unfortunately still don't know about this languages)
         - Json and jq

Leetcode initiate first solve but copy and look on the problem for 

960:  Delete Columns to Make Sorted II

       this problem looks very similar to the Delete Columns to Make Sorted II we solved yesterday. But in the earlier version, our goal was to make the array of strings lexicographically sorted with respect to each other. Here however, the requirement subtly changes: after deleting some columns, each individual string (row) must be lexicographically sorted on its own. Instead of comparing rows with one another, we now focus on preserving order within the same row, while still deleting columns globally. - Srinivasa Pradeep

I haven't full grasp whats all of this about but as you can see I wanna try and understand it although C++ and other language im not quite good at this.

Im starting to day 1 in leetcode tomorrow, but all good today no need to rush.

Day 6 - 12.23.25

Not so productive shit or anything
Gone through immersing myself on what to do to my Pocketbook 
       Koreader failure, win, failure
              Been Doing what i have to do to finish this.

- Step 3: Let us know how it went!
         -It went good although i did not know or why i did not put the ssh key before but anyway all success now. (Small steps is much better compared to none.)

Day 12 - 12.29.25 Early a bit but could lapse 50mins for this (hopefully)

- (done) Read chapters 1.1 through 1.4 from the Getting Started section of Pro Git to learn the differences between local, centralized, and distributed version control systems.
- (done) Watch “What is Git?” explained in 2 minutes - a video about what Git is and how it can improve the workflow of both an individual and a team of developers.
- (done) Read “About GitHub and Git” for a brief introduction of what GitHub is and how Git and GitHub work together. You can skip the “Where do I start?” section at the end.
- (done) If you haven’t yet installed Git, visit the Setting Up Git lesson.
- (done) Take a look at The Odin Project’s GitHub repository. This is where all the lessons are stored! While you’re there, look at all our contributors to gain an appreciation for how Git records all collaborative efforts and how GitHub visually represents this.
- Putting git to test.
- done hopefully the test after i commit this.

Day 13 - 12.30.25 OH GODS i never thought i did so much yesterday and now im dead lol.

Day 45 - 01.31.26

- Starting again
- At the freecodecamp.org starting back to zero in Python.'

Day 46 - 02.01.26

- HEllo im in Blender right now.
- Here are the most common data types you'll use in Python:

    Integer: A whole number without decimals, for example, 10 or -5.

my_integer_var = 10
print('Integer:', my_integer_var) # Integer: 10

    Float: A number with a decimal point, like 4.41 or -0.4.

my_float_var = 4.50
print('Float:', my_float_var) # Float: 4.5

    String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotation marks like 'Hello world!'.

my_string_var = 'hello'
print('String:', my_string_var) # String: hello

    Boolean: A true or false type, written as True or False.

my_boolean_var = True
print('Boolean:', my_boolean_var) # Boolean: True

    Set: An unordered collection of unique elements, like {4, 2, 0}.

my_set_var = {7, 5, 8}
print('Set:', my_set_var) # Set: {7, 5, 8}

    Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, like {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 28}.

my_dictionary_var = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print('Dictionary:', my_dictionary_var) # Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}

    Tuple: An immutable ordered collection, enclosed in brackets, like (7, 8, 4).

my_tuple_var = (7, 5, 8)
print('Tuple:', my_tuple_var) # Tuple: (7, 5, 8)

    Range: A sequence of numbers, often used in loops, for example, range(5).

my_range_var = range(5)
print('Range:', my_range_var) # Range: range(0, 5)

    List: An ordered collection of elements that supports different data types.

my_list = [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]
print(my_list) # [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]

    None: A special value that represents the absence of a value.

my_none_var = None
print('None:', my_none_var) # None: None

To get the data type of a variable, you can use the type() function:

my_var_1 = 'Hello world'
my_var_2 = 21

print(type(my_var_1)) # <class 'str'>
print(type (my_var_2)) # <class 'int'>

And here's are all the data types covered in this lesson, along with their types in the terminal:

my_integer_var = 10
print(type(my_integer_var))  # <class 'int'>

my_float_var = 4.50
print(type(my_float_var))  # <class 'float'>

my_string_var = 'hello'
print(type(my_string_var))  # <class 'str'>

my_boolean_var = True
print(type(my_boolean_var))  # <class 'bool'>

my_set_var = {7, 5, 8}
print(type(my_set_var))  # <class 'set'>

my_dictionary_var = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print(type(my_dictionary_var))  # <class 'dict'>

my_tuple_var = (7, 5, 8)
print(type(my_tuple_var))  # <class 'tuple'>

my_range_var = range(5)
print(type(my_range_var))  # <class 'range'>

my_list = [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]
print(type(my_list)) # <class 'list'>

my_none_var = None
print(type(my_none_var))  # <class 'NoneType'>

The built-in isinstance() function lets you check if a variable matches a specific data type. It takes in an object and the type you want to check it against, then returns a boolean. Here are some examples:

isinstance('Hello world', str) # True
isinstance(True, bool) # True
isinstance(42, int) # True
isinstance('John Doe', int) # False
